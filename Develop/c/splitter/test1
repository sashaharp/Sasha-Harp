This is a test document about a strange person, who appeared in the little town of Nobleville 2 months ago.

2nd of May 1978, Nobleville.
Report about suspected extrasensoric abilities:

On the 25th of February, at 12:25, a tall man with a walking stick in his right hand, dressed in long robes entered the village
(appendix 1 - a sketch of the man)
The man asked strange questions about "magic or sorcery". He was interested on the opinion of the townsfolk about it.
(appendix 2 - the exact formulations of the questions recovered from questioning people that were asked)
At 14:10 the man offered his services as a "healer" and healed 2 cows, a pig, and a horse seemingly through laying on hands.
(appendix 3 - results of a medical examination performed by a specialist 10 days after the incident)
The owner of the cows offered shelter for the night as payment for the healing.
The next day, the stranger again healed a few animals and saved an old lady from a heart attack.
At 15:50 a sudden thunderstorm began. Multiple wittnesses claim the man was hit by lightning 15 times.
Some claim there was an invisible shield above the man and the lightning was blocked by it.
At 16:10 the storm stopped, and the man dissapeared.
